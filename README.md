# **Project**

## Objective
I decided to build an online store focused on handmade products because I believe that most people can identify with handmade items and are willing to buy them, knowing they are getting products crafted with human time and expertise to ensure high quality and longevity. I aimed to create the site as authentically as possible while demonstrating my knowledge of the Django framework, Python, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.

## Site Users Goal
The users of 'HandCraft' are a diverse group of people with various interests and desires, including art lovers, collectors, fashion enthusiasts, jewelry lovers, and more. The site provides a unique platform where users can find rare and delicate custom-made products all in one place. HandCraft offers items that are seldom found elsewhere, providing users the convenience of ordering them from the comfort of their own homes.

## Site Owners Goal
The goal of the site owner is to create a platform where users can intuitively purchase handcrafted items of all sorts, combining multiple genres in one place.

## Business Model
To know which business model that fits the needs and requirements for a business is of course very important. HandCraft is a business that sells the products directly to the end users through direct selling via the HandCraft webpage. The buyers are private consumers which makes HandCraft business model a B2C (Business To Consumer)-model. This means that everytime a HandCraft customer buys something from the webpage a B2C transaction is completed. To be able to implement a B2C eCommerce model in a successful way it is very important to have a quickly adjustable platform to be able to adapt to the customers if needed. The HandCraft webpage is a highly adjustable platform which makes fast adjustments quite easy. But to have a solid platform is not everything, of course there is a need for good marketing techniques to be able to reach out to new customers and engage the existing ones.

## Marketing Techniques
There are a lot of different marketing techniques out there. For HandCraft there has from the start been some areas that builds the foundation of the HandCraft trademark, and also sets the prerequisites to reach the customers.

* **Optimize For Mobile Devices**

In a world where most of the people visits the web from a mobile device it is very important that the site looks good on mobiles and tablets. The HandCraft site is fully responsive which means that it takes into account whether the customer uses a mobile or desktop device.

* **The Website Layout**

The HandCraft website is easy to navigate and have an intuitive design which makes it easy for the customer to find relevant information and make a purchase without a hassle.

* **Rate content**

On the HandCraft site, there is a Customer Review section that displays user ratings below each product. This helps the HandCraft team better understand the desires and needs of their customers and can serve as an indicator for adding new products to the stock. This makes it possible to offer more relevant products in the future that better fit user needs. HandCraft's ambition is for customers to visit our site because they want to, not because we want them to.

* **Facebook and Instagram (social media marketing)**

Social Media marketing is a great tool if it's done in the right way. HandCraft has a presence on social media through Facebook. It helps HandCraft to communicate with both existing customers but also potential new ones. Through the social media platforms HandCraft can create engagement, interact on a broad level and maintain brand recognition. For HandCraft the product sale is being made on the site why it is very important to use the social media platforms to boost traffic to the website (i.e. when a new collection has been published or when the product of the month has been released). For now HandCraft only focuses on organic growth but will most likely start with payed ads to target specific customer groups in the future.

    * Meta Description - Explore HandCraft's unique collection of handmade goods across various genres. Discover exquisite pieces for your home, wardrobe, and more. Shop now and experience the artistry firsthand.
